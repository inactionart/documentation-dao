Audiophile, multi-artist. Traveling the globe, working various jobs, taking photographs, and making documentaries, Ren√£o lives by his own essence. As the son of an architect and a law graduate, he finds inspiration to collaborate in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. As a bilingual individual, he seeks to interact with academic and university communities. Researching and generating content, connecting DAOs? Perhaps. He is always striving to do his best, fulfilling various roles and tasks.

Skater, eSports analyst, former fan of traditional sports, and poet. He enjoys ‚ÄúBass Cannon‚Äù by Flux Pavilion and ‚ÄúMasks‚Äù by Cavalier. As a content creator, designer, and cinephile, he has experience working while generating copyrighted content. He has worked with Conselheira101, Serh1 Consultoria, NUPED/PRE-UFPel, Nike, Sparkoff, and PSOL, always engaging with cultural, corporate, and institutional causes and cases.

He is always striving to create a unique experience amidst the layers of life, drawing inspiration from art, design, and science. He entered the world of Web 2.0 at the age of 7 and discovered Web 3.0 in 2021, driven by demands directly related to music, executive production, and directing people to take action.

**He will be programming, with his art!**
