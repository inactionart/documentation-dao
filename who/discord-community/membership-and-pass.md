Here is a membership to you. Who search constantly and invests a lot of time doing stuff for you and some DAOs.

You can't have some graduation to make something here, in [INAction Community](https://discord.gg/9z76caYWWe). Is always good to have some privacy developing something that never happened. Do all in your time, think and publish it on [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/inaction-collective) or [GitHub](https://github.com/inactionart).

Programming some bars, doing some cool images with AI/AR. Do it cool and in your time, using techniques or something modern, sharing it with us using your own works or the [Premium Chat](https://discord.gg/FR9vs3AvsV).

You're welcome and _**let's get it**_!

The payments of activities are made by [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/), too

A pass to be a member and have access to all the rooms that we disposed to our members. Here you can dialog with invited members, too. Sharing some cool things in private rooms, you can solve something talking in Talks 2, 3, 4 and 5.&#x20;
