# Origin

Idealized by South, Rio and SÃ£o Paulo members, iNAction has a big deal. Culture (including music and plastic arts) in one place. Do you like to do some design? We will help you to generate this. If you like music? We will help you to publicate it and distribute. All with the same power and respect.&#x20;

We want you executing your creative plan, the area? Fuck **that**. 'll be your creativity versus the world. Until some world collide? Maybe. We want you living, happy. Doing some money, living the dream, liking your own moment.

Percentually? We win something, but the majority stay with you. You deserving, executing and realizing your dream supported by our managers, partners, gurus or founders.\
\
We really want you to grow, big. \
The name is iNAction, in-action.\
\
**Film + Art + Design + Sound = iNAction**

## Let's Make a NFT Collection?

#### My cousin had the big idea...

COVID-19 dominating the world. Some minds versus delirium. Some talks on WhatsApp and.. Lucas called me sayin: **bruv, let's make some nft collection** and with me replying: **well, maybe... i have to read about to realize it**. \
\
2/3 years after it, there we come with a venerous ownership and respect envolving tribes from web3. \
\
I'm really really happy with this journey. \
\
Thanks for all people from Twitter and Instagram.\
